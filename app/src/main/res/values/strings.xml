    <string name="rules" tools:ignore="TypographyDashes">ORIGINAL RULES\nCaravan is played with two players building three opposing piles (or \"caravans\") of numbered cards. The goal is to outbid your opponent\'s caravan with the highest value of numbered cards without being too light (under 21) or overburdened (over 26).\n\nThe game begins with each player taking eight cards from their deck and placing either one numerical card or ace on each caravan. Players may not discard during this initial round.\n\nOnce both players have started their three caravans, each player may do ONE of the following on their turn:\n1. Play one card and draw a new card from his or her deck to their hand.\n2. Discard one card from their hand and draw a new card from his or her deck.\n3. Disband one of their three caravans by removing all cards from that pile.\n\nCaravans have a direction, either ascending or descending numerically, and a suit. The suit is determined with the first card placed on a caravan, the direction by the second. All subsequent cards must continue the numerical direction or match the suit of the previous card. Cards of the same numerical value cannot be played in sequence, regardless of suit. Face cards can be attached to numeric cards in any caravan and affects them in various ways.\n\nCARD VALUES\nJoker: Played against ace, 2-10. Effects change based on whether it\'s an ace or a numbered card (see below). Multiple jokers may be played on the same card.\n\nAce: Value of 1. Jokers played on aces remove all other non-face cards of the ace\'s suit from the table. E.g. a joker played on an Ace of Spades removes all spades (except face cards and that card, specifically) from the table.\n\n2-10: Listed value. Jokers played on these cards remove all other cards of this value from the table. E.g. a joker played on a 4 of Hearts removes all 4s (other than that card, specifically) from the table.\n\nJack: Played against ace, 2\-10. Removes that card, along with any face cards attached to it.\n\nQueen: Played against ace, 2\-10. Reverses the current direction of the hand and changes the current suit of the hand. Multiple queens may be played on the same card.\n\nKing: Played against ace, 2\-10. Adds the value of that card again. E.g. a king played on a 9 adds 9 to that hand. Multiple kings may be played on the same card for multiplicative effects. E.g. 4+ king = 8. 4 + 2 kings = 16.\n\nWINNING\nA player\'s caravan is considered sold when the value of its cards is over 20 and under 27. The other player may still outbid by increasing the value of their opposing pile while staying within the 21-26 range. When each of the three competing caravans has sold, the game is over. In the event that one of the three caravan values are tied between players, the game continues until all three caravans have sold. The player with two or more sales wins the pot.</string>

    <string name="kyle">Kyle says:</string>
    <string name="tutorial_1_1">Howdy! Fine hot day for a Sarsaparilla, ain\'t it?\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_1_2">Days like this are the reason why I ain\'t leaving Mojave, not for anything.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_2">While we wait, how about a game of Caravan?</string>
    <string name="tutorial_3">You don\'t know the rules? Ain\'t a problem. Gonna teach you while we are waiting.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_5">Your deck now has only ten cards. That is only for teaching you. In the field your deck is bigger.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_6_1">Usually people of Mojave play with custom decks.\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_6_2">I then say \'sticks and stones\' and whip out the deck of 6s and 10s and Ks.\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_6_3">After I beat them, they don\'t play with me no more. That\'s why I prefer balanced rules.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_7">In balanced rules both players start with a full deck o\' 54. It is more - you guessed it - balanced.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_8_1">Each player has three caravans - left, central and right.\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_9_1">The game starts like this: we take 8 cards from our decks to our hand.\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_9_2">Then we have to start each caravan by placing an ace or 2\-10 card on top.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_10">To place a card on top of a caravan, select it in your hand and then click the green rectangle. If it is not green or it is missing, you cannot place card on top.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_11">Now start your caravans.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_12">Good job.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_13">You might ask: \'What if all 8 cards are, let\'s say, Jacks and Kings, and no aces or 2\-10?\'</string>
    <string name="tutorial_14">Well, if you play with someone else, you\'d have to reshuffle your deck.\nMe though, I never had that.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_15_1">Sometimes there is a rule that you can discard the card during the opening phase.\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_15_2">If you ask me, it seems like a huge advantage, so we ain\'t.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_16">Now the game begins truly. You have a choice of four.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_17">Let\'s start with discarding cards from your hand. It is the easiest one.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_18">Select any card, and the discard button will appear on your right. When you press it, the card is gone.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_19">Now, discard any face card, preferably Queen.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_warning">Warning!</string>
    <string name="tutorial_20_1">You can do, actually, whatever you want. You can discard a non-face card or put a card onto a caravan.\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_20_2">However, it is like travelling to Vegas through the north - may break the game, difficult and not worth it ;)</string>
    <string name="tutorial_21_1">"Nice. Have you noticed that a card was added in your hand? "</string>
    <string name="tutorial_21_2">There are always 5 cards in your hand, unless your deck is empty.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_22">Now let\'s talk about how to build a caravan. You do it with aces or 2\-10 cards.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_23">Each of those cards has a value: 1 for ace, 2 for 2,… 10 for 10.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_24">However, you cannot just put any card. You can\'t put on top of a caravan the card of the same rank as the caravan\'s current top card.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_25">Also, you have to follow one of two rules:</string>
    <string name="tutorial_26_1">"either the card you want to add to a caravan has the same suit as the caravan's current top card, "</string>
    <string name="tutorial_26_2">or its rank follows the caravan\'s numerical sequence.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_27_1">Numerical sequence is determined by the top two cards of the caravan.\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_27_2">If the top rank is greater than the pre-top card rank, the new card must have a value greater than the top.\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_27_3">If the top rank is less than the pre-top card rank, the new card must have a value less than the top.\n\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_27_4">In raider\'s terms: if it grows - go bigger, if it shrinks - go smaller.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_28">Now put all non-face cards onto caravans. Try to build a long one. Show me how you understood the rules.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_30">Well done. Building a caravan is the most difficult part of the game.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_31">You can also disband caravans. You should do it, if its value is too big to handle with Jacks and Jokers.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_32">To disband a caravan tap DISBAND! button above caravan, then tap button that says DISBAND CARAVAN on the right.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_33">Disband all your caravans.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_34">Now let us talk about Jacks, Queens, Kings and Jokers.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_35">You put them not on top of a caravan, but on one of the caravan\'s cards. Hell, even on the cards from my caravan.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_36">First of all: you can put only three cards on a card, unless it is Jack.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_37">King, if you put it on a card, doubles the total value of that card.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_38">Jack just removes the card from a caravan, with all its face cards.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_39">Queen reverses the current numerical direction of the caravan, and changes the suit of the caravan to that of the Queen.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_40">Finally, Joker. It is like Jack, but way more powerful.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_41">If you put Joker onto an ace of some suit, all other number cards from all caravans that share the same suit of the ace are removed.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_42">If you put Joker onto a 2\-10 card, all other number cards of the same rank from all caravans are removed.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_43">The card you have put Joker onto is safe for now. However, if any other Joker is played, that card is removed.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_44">Hard, I know. But it is the hardest part - remembering what face cards do.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_45">Now get rid of all cards from your hand. Use face cards on my cards.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_46">Congratulations! You have lost!</string>
    <string name="tutorial_47">You have no cards to build a caravan with. It means I win.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_48">However, it is rare for the game of Caravan to end like this.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_8_2">Caravans in the same column - opposing - are competing with each other.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_49_1">"The game\'s target is to sell two or three of your caravans at a higher sum, or \"bid\", "</string>
    <string name="tutorial_49_2">than the opposing caravan. The bid is determined by the cards in the caravan.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_50">A caravan is considered sold when its bid is within 21\-26 range; any bid that is higher or lower is not a sold caravan.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_51">Usually, the game is over when in each of the opposing caravan pairs one of the caravans is sold at the higher bid.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_52">If two caravans are sold with the same bid, the game continues until one of the caravans has a higher bid, but no more than 26.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_53">That\'s it. I am not going to tell all my tricks, you should figure the game out yourself.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_56">See ya round.</string>

    <string name="next_slide">[NEXT SLIDE]</string>
    <string name="intro_1">Humanity learns it time and time again the hard way. World Wars, Great War… they went and gone, and people are still inventing reasons to fight and to kill.</string>
    <string name="intro_2">When the radioactive dust settled upon America, different factions emerged. NCR, Legion, Followers of Apocalypse - all with different goals and different methods.</string>
    <string name="intro_3">In Mojave Wasteland, however, there was no single force that could unite the whole area.</string>
    <string name="intro_4">That led to battles, big and small, across the territory. Fighting and killing, all over again.</string>
    <string name="intro_5">Many people of Mojave had escaped, yet many more still cling to their homeland.</string>
    <string name="intro_6">You are the Prospector, a child of the Mojave Wasteland, hardened by the harsh life in the desert and teased by the luxuries of the neon lights of New Vegas.</string>
    <string name="intro_7">Your lifelong quest is to get to this shining oasis behind the walls and guns of securitrons, to lock your place there and live in safety, knowing no war.</string>
    <string name="intro_8">To change your life for good, you had become a vulture for the rotting parts of the Old World, seeking to salvage, repair and sell off to whoever might find them a better use.</string>
    <string name="intro_9">One day, you take the trip of your life to legendary Sierra Madre, the city covered by the red mist that kills everyone who is not careful enough. You waste almost all your resources, all your Stealth Boys, but you are finally here.</string>
    <string name="intro_10">What seemed like a suicide mission might finally bring what you were looking for… peace.</string>

    <string name="chapter_1_text_1">It is a story of the Prospector. A child of the Mojave Wasteland, hardened by the harsh life in the desert and teased by the luxuries of the neon lights of New Vegas, doors of which are closed to ones of his kind.</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_q_1">Ooh, poor guy! What did he do?</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_text_2">To change his life for good, the Prospector had become a vulture for the rotting parts of the Old World, seeking to salvage, repair and sell off to whoever might find them a better use.</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_q_2">Huh, where did he go, I wonder?</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_text_3">Naturally, the first place that captivated him was the Sierra Madre casino, of which so many legends reached his ears.</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_q_3">Sierra Madre? I thought the place is off limits.</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_text_4">Since the legendary Courier Six cleared the Sierra Madre villa, countless gangs and punks took everything of value to a primitive mind: water, food, weapons, clothing, medical supplies. Sierra Madre chips and bottle caps were gone, yet the technology remained untouched.</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_q_4">So what did the Prospector find?</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_text_5">One of the working RobCo terminals, so promising to be informative, was protected by a hologuard, who was not aggressive and offered the Prospector a challenge in the friendly game of Caravan, wagering the information he preserves.</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_on_win">Defeated, the hologuard shrugged his shoulders and vanished, leaving behind brand new Sierra Madre Deck!</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_on_lose">Trying to find anything useful in Sierra Madre, the Prospector gets lost in Cloud and die. His body is never found.</string>

Rules of Caravan in the App!
\n\n
1.0 REQUIREMENTS
\n\n
1.1) Two-player game.
\n
1.2) One of the following:
\n
- two 54-card decks with one deck for each player
\n
- customized deck provided that it consists of at least 30 cards, at least 15 non-face cards, at most 6 playing decks are used, and the deck doesn\'t contain two of the same card with the same back (e.g. two 3 of diamonds with Tops deck). The maximum amount of cards is derived from the maximum number of playing decks (6) and is 54 * 6 = 324.

    </string>

    <string name="better_rules_body_2">

2.0 SETUP
\n\n
Player 1
\n
Caravan 1 	Caravan 2 	Caravan 3
\n\n
Caravan 1 	Caravan 2 	Caravan 3
\n
Player 2
\n\n
2.1) Throughout the game, Player 1\'s caravan 1 will be directly competing against Player 2\'s caravan 1 - the same goes for caravans 2 and 3.

    </string>

    <string name="better_rules_body_3">

3.0 SELLING CARAVANS
\n\n
3.1) All caravans have \"bid\". The bid of a caravan is determined by adding together the total sum of each number card (including Kings; see part 5.36) played in that caravan.
\n\n
3.2) A caravan is considered sold when it reaches a bid of 21-26; any bid that is higher or lower is not a sold caravan.
\n\n
3.3) You may add onto an already sold caravan to increase its bid.

    </string>

    <string name="better_rules_body_4">

4.0 INIT STAGE!
\n\n
4.1) To start, each player draws eight cards from their shuffled deck.
\n\n
4.2) During this init stage you can only place number cards (2-10) or aces. The init stage in its entirety consists of three alternating turns for each player, in which they must use those turns to play a card face-up to start off each of their three caravans.
\n\n
4.3) You are not allowed to discard cards during this phase. The deck is shuffled and the hand is selected the way that always allows to place three number cards or aces.
\n\n
4.4) During this phase you do not re-draw cards. Once each player has taken turns placing their three cards, the init stage is over. After this phase ends both players will be continuing with five cards.

    </string>

    <string name="better_rules_body_5">


5.0 GAMEPLAY
\n\n
5.1) Once the opening round ends, you are then permitted to play any card. Players will alternate turns, doing one of the following:
\n
    - Play a card from your hand, then draw a new card.
\n
    - Discard a card from your hand, then draw a new card.
\n
    - Disband one of your caravan tracks. This removes all cards from one caravan.
\n\n
5.2) Number Cards (A=1, 2-10=face value)
\n\n
5.21) To play a number card refer to the last card played in the selected caravan - it must follow a suit or a numerical (ascending or descending) sequence. If there is only one card in the caravan, then the next number card played sets the numerical direction and determines the suit. From here, as long as a number card matches the suit or follows the numerical sequence, then it\'s allowed to be played in that caravan.
\n\n
5.22) Numerical sequences don\'t need to be directly connected - you can go up from a three to a seven, or down from a seven to a three. In the latter case, the sequence is descending, so only a deuce or ace could be played as a number card.
\n\n
5.23) If playing a card that matches suit is contrary to the current numerical sequence of that caravan, then the new card establishes a new numerical sequence for that caravan.
\n\n
5.24) Under no circumstances are you allowed to play a number card on the same number card (e.g. a 10 on a 10).
\n\n
5.25) Number cards can only be played within your own caravans.
\n\n\n
5.3) FACE CARDS &amp; JOKERS (J, Q, K, Joker)
\n\n
5.31) Jacks, Queens, Kings, and Jokers all have special effects. Unlike number cards, which are played overlapping each other downwards, these cards are attached to the side of and overlapping the card it is played on.
\n\n
5.32) Face cards and Jokers can be played on both your and your opponent\'s caravans.
\n\n
5.33) Face cards and Jokers don\'t need to follow suit or sequence, and can be played on any number card no matter the card\'s location in the caravan.
\n\n
5.34) JACK - Removes the card it is played on as well as any face cards/Jokers attached.
\n
5.35) QUEEN - Reverses the current numerical direction of the caravan, and changes the suit of the caravan to that of the Queen. Multiple Queens can be used on the same card to reverse the effects.
\n
5.36) KING - Doubles the value of the card the King is played on. Multiple Kings can be used on the same card (e.g. 10+K = 20; 10+K+K = 40).
\n
5.37) JOKER:
        \n
        - If played on an ace, it removes from both player\'s caravans all other number cards that share the suit of the ace (Queens altering the suit of a caravan will not save the card - the suit is considered what is printed on the number card).
        \n
        - If played on a number card that is not an ace, it removes from both player\'s caravans all other number cards of the same value/instance. A played Joker only affects cards that have been played before it. In any case, the number card the Joker is played on is spared. All attaching face cards of the removed cards are also removed.
\n\n
5.38) Face cards and Jokers can be played/attached with full effect on cards with other face cards and Jokers attached. There can be no more than three face cards or Jokers attached/played to a single number card at one time. The exception is a Jack: it can be attached as a fourth face card.
\n\n
5.4) If in the event that a Jack or Joker removes a card, leaving a caravan sequence stuck with two identical number cards, then the sequence is considered undefined, and number card of any value (except the last card value) can be played.
\n\n
5.5) After the opening round, if any caravan track becomes empty of cards, you are not required to start bidding on the empty caravan immediately. Technically, you could win the game with only two caravans.

    </string>

    <string name="better_rules_body_6">

6.0 WINNING
\n\n
6.1) To determine the caravan\'s bid, you simply add the total sum of a caravan\'s number cards plus the added value of Kings.
\n\n
6.2) The winning requirements are as follows: the game ends when in an each pair of competing caravans one of them is sold at a higher bid than the opposing caravan. Winner is the player who has sold 2 or 3 caravans at a higher bid.
\n
6.2.1) It is important to note that if competing caravans are both sold at equal bids, then with that tie, neither caravan is considered sold. In this case, the game continues until there is no tie between competing caravans.
\n\n
6.3) If you run out of cards to play before meeting the criteria of winning, then your opponent automatically wins the game.

    <string name="better_rules_body_7">

7.0 WILD WASTELAND
\n\n
7.1) Sometimes you might see some weird cards. They have black-and-green coloring, have a non-standard rank and no suit. Those are the Wild Wasteland cards:
\n
7.11) CAZADOR - when it\'s put on a caravan, decreases rank of every number card in this caravan every turn, with every Ace just disappearing. If combined with an ordinary Queen, it increases rank of every number card (except 10) in this caravan every turn.
\n
7.12) UFO - when it is put on a field, every card (except the card UFO is put on) has a chance of disappearing.
\n
7.13) MUGGY - when it is put on a caravan, no one can put any face card on any card of this caravan. Also protects from nuclear explosion.
\n
7.14) DIFFICULT PETE - when it is put on a field, all number cards are turning into 10s. Suit and attached face cards remain the same.
\n
7.15) YES MAN - if there is a YES MAN card on any card of the caravan, the bid of this caravan is 26, no matter what cards are there.
\n
7.16) FEV - if it is put on a card from one of the player\'s/enemy\'s caravans, all cards in hand of the player/enemy are turned into the FEV-host card.
\n\n
7.17) NUCLEAR EXPLOSION - when it is put on a caravan X, every caravan is dropped, except caravan X (and caravans that are protected by Muggy).
\n\n
7.2) Wild Wasteland cards cannot be added in custom deck or in the deck o\' 54 by player. However, they can be added in multiplayer by selecting the checkbox; also, some AI enemies have the Wild Wasteland cards in their deck.

    <string name="faq_q1">Q1: Are there differences with original Caravan from New Vegas?</string>
    <string name="faq_a1">A1: Yes, but they are minor. For example, cards discarding during init stage is allowed in FNV, but disallowed here.</string>
    <string name="faq_q2">Q2: I have two caravans sold, but the game has not ended with my victory!</string>
    <string name="faq_a2">A2: The game ends when in each pair of competing caravans one is sold with higher bid. In your case, probably, the third caravan pair has no sold caravan or both caravans have same bid.</string>

    <string name="faq_q5">Q5: How do I get cards for custom deck?</string>
    <string name="faq_a5">A5: Well, from the beginning you have standard deck available. Then, most of the cards are bought from traders.
        The exceptions are Standard deck ALT (cards are dropped in multiplayer) and Madness deck (cards are dropped for defeating Madness Cardinal).</string>
