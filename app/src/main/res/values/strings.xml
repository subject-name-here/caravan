    <string name="rules" tools:ignore="TypographyDashes">ORIGINAL RULES\nCaravan is played with two players building three opposing piles (or \"caravans\") of numbered cards. The goal is to outbid your opponent\'s caravan with the highest value of numbered cards without being too light (under 21) or overburdened (over 26).\n\nThe game begins with each player taking eight cards from their deck and placing either one numerical card or ace on each caravan. Players may not discard during this initial round.\n\nOnce both players have started their three caravans, each player may do ONE of the following on their turn:\n1. Play one card and draw a new card from his or her deck to their hand.\n2. Discard one card from their hand and draw a new card from his or her deck.\n3. Disband one of their three caravans by removing all cards from that pile.\n\nCaravans have a direction, either ascending or descending numerically, and a suit. The suit is determined with the first card placed on a caravan, the direction by the second. All subsequent cards must continue the numerical direction or match the suit of the previous card. Cards of the same numerical value cannot be played in sequence, regardless of suit. Face cards can be attached to numeric cards in any caravan and affects them in various ways.\n\nCARD VALUES\nJoker: Played against ace, 2-10. Effects change based on whether it\'s an ace or a numbered card (see below). Multiple jokers may be played on the same card.\n\nAce: Value of 1. Jokers played on aces remove all other non-face cards of the ace\'s suit from the table. E.g. a joker played on an Ace of Spades removes all spades (except face cards and that card, specifically) from the table.\n\n2-10: Listed value. Jokers played on these cards remove all other cards of this value from the table. E.g. a joker played on a 4 of Hearts removes all 4s (other than that card, specifically) from the table.\n\nJack: Played against ace, 2\-10. Removes that card, along with any face cards attached to it.\n\nQueen: Played against ace, 2\-10. Reverses the current direction of the hand and changes the current suit of the hand. Multiple queens may be played on the same card.\n\nKing: Played against ace, 2\-10. Adds the value of that card again. E.g. a king played on a 9 adds 9 to that hand. Multiple kings may be played on the same card for multiplicative effects. E.g. 4+ king = 8. 4 + 2 kings = 16.\n\nWINNING\nA player\'s caravan is considered sold when the value of its cards is over 20 and under 27. The other player may still outbid by increasing the value of their opposing pile while staying within the 21-26 range. When each of the three competing caravans has sold, the game is over. In the event that one of the three caravan values are tied between players, the game continues until all three caravans have sold. The player with two or more sales wins the pot.</string>

    <string name="kyle">Kyle says:</string>
    <string name="tutorial_1_1">Howdy! Fine hot day for a Sarsaparilla, ain\'t it?\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_1_2">Days like this are the reason why I ain\'t leaving Mojave, not for anything.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_2">While we wait, how about a game of Caravan?</string>
    <string name="tutorial_3">You don\'t know the rules? Ain\'t a problem. Gonna teach you while we are waiting.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_5">Your deck now has only ten cards. That is only for teaching you. In the field your deck is bigger.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_6_1">Usually people of Mojave play with custom decks.\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_6_2">I then say \'sticks and stones\' and whip out the deck of 6s and 10s and Ks.\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_6_3">After I beat them, they don\'t play with me no more. That\'s why I prefer balanced rules.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_7">In balanced rules both players start with a full deck o\' 54. It is more - you guessed it - balanced.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_8_1">Each player has three caravans - left, central and right.\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_9_1">The game starts like this: we take 8 cards from our decks to our hand.\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_9_2">Then we have to start each caravan by placing an ace or 2\-10 card on top.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_10">To place a card on top of a caravan, select it in your hand and then click the green rectangle. If it is not green or it is missing, you cannot place card on top.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_11">Now start your caravans.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_12">Good job.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_13">You might ask: \'What if all 8 cards are, let\'s say, Jacks and Kings, and no aces or 2\-10?\'</string>
    <string name="tutorial_14">Well, if you play with someone else, you\'d have to reshuffle your deck.\nMe though, I never had that.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_15_1">Sometimes there is a rule that you can discard the card during the opening phase.\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_15_2">If you ask me, it seems like a huge advantage, so we ain\'t.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_16">Now the game begins truly. You have a choice of four.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_17">Let\'s start with discarding cards from your hand. It is the easiest one.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_18">Select any card, and the discard button will appear on your right. When you press it, the card is gone.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_19">Now, discard any face card, preferably Queen.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_warning">Warning!</string>
    <string name="tutorial_20_1">You can do, actually, whatever you want. You can discard a non-face card or put a card onto a caravan.\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_20_2">However, it is like travelling to Vegas through the north - may break the game, difficult and not worth it ;)</string>
    <string name="tutorial_21_1">"Nice. Have you noticed that a card was added in your hand? "</string>
    <string name="tutorial_21_2">There are always 5 cards in your hand, unless your deck is empty.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_22">Now let\'s talk about how to build a caravan. You do it with aces or 2\-10 cards.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_23">Each of those cards has a value: 1 for ace, 2 for 2,… 10 for 10.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_24">However, you cannot just put any card. You can\'t put on top of a caravan the card of the same rank as the caravan\'s current top card.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_25">Also, you have to follow one of two rules:</string>
    <string name="tutorial_26_1">"either the card you want to add to a caravan has the same suit as the caravan's current top card, "</string>
    <string name="tutorial_26_2">or its rank follows the caravan\'s numerical sequence.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_27_1">Numerical sequence is determined by the top two cards of the caravan.\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_27_2">If the top rank is greater than the pre-top card rank, the new card must have a value greater than the top.\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_27_3">If the top rank is less than the pre-top card rank, the new card must have a value less than the top.\n\n</string>
    <string name="tutorial_27_4">In raider\'s terms: if it grows - go bigger, if it shrinks - go smaller.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_28">Now put all non-face cards onto caravans. Try to build a long one. Show me how you understood the rules.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_30">Well done. Building a caravan is the most difficult part of the game.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_31">You can also disband caravans. You should do it, if its value is too big to handle with Jacks and Jokers.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_32">To disband a caravan tap DISBAND! button above caravan, then tap button that says DISBAND CARAVAN on the right.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_33">Disband all your caravans.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_34">Now let us talk about Jacks, Queens, Kings and Jokers.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_35">You put them not on top of a caravan, but on one of the caravan\'s cards. Hell, even on the cards from my caravan.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_36">First of all: you can put only three cards on a card, unless it is Jack.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_37">King, if you put it on a card, doubles the total value of that card.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_38">Jack just removes the card from a caravan, with all its face cards.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_39">Queen reverses the current numerical direction of the caravan, and changes the suit of the caravan to that of the Queen.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_40">Finally, Joker. It is like Jack, but way more powerful.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_41">If you put Joker onto an ace of some suit, all other number cards from all caravans that share the same suit of the ace are removed.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_42">If you put Joker onto a 2\-10 card, all other number cards of the same rank from all caravans are removed.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_43">The card you have put Joker onto is safe for now. However, if any other Joker is played, that card is removed.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_44">Hard, I know. But it is the hardest part - remembering what face cards do.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_45">Now get rid of all cards from your hand. Use face cards on my cards.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_46">Congratulations! You have lost!</string>
    <string name="tutorial_47">You have no cards to build a caravan with. It means I win.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_48">However, it is rare for the game of Caravan to end like this.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_8_2">Caravans in the same column - opposing - are competing with each other.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_49_1">"The game\'s target is to sell two or three of your caravans at a higher sum, or \"bid\", "</string>
    <string name="tutorial_49_2">than the opposing caravan. The bid is determined by the cards in the caravan.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_50">A caravan is considered sold when its bid is within 21\-26 range; any bid that is higher or lower is not a sold caravan.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_51">Usually, the game is over when in each of the opposing caravan pairs one of the caravans is sold at the higher bid.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_52">If two caravans are sold with the same bid, the game continues until one of the caravans has a higher bid, but no more than 26.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_53">That\'s it. I am not going to tell all my tricks, you should figure the game out yourself.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_56">See ya round.</string>

    <string name="chapter_the_end_slides">The End Slides.</string>

    <string name="chapter_1_text_1">It is a story of the Prospector. A child of the Mojave Wasteland, hardened by the harsh life in the desert and teased by the luxuries of the neon lights of New Vegas, doors of which are closed to ones of his kind.</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_q_1">Ooh, poor guy! What did he do?</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_text_2">To change his life for good, the Prospector had become a vulture for the rotting parts of the Old World, seeking to salvage, repair and sell off to whoever might find them a better use.</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_q_2">Huh, where did he go, I wonder?</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_text_3">Naturally, the first place that captivated him was the Sierra Madre casino, of which so many legends reached his ears.</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_q_3">Sierra Madre? I thought the place is off limits.</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_text_4">Since the legendary Courier Six cleared the Sierra Madre villa, countless gangs and punks took everything of value to a primitive mind: water, food, weapons, clothing, medical supplies. Sierra Madre chips and bottle caps were gone, yet the technology remained untouched.</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_q_4">So what did the Prospector find?</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_text_5">One of the working RobCo terminals, so promising to be informative, was protected by a hologuard, who was not aggressive and offered the Prospector a challenge in the friendly game of Caravan, wagering the information he preserves.</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_on_win">Defeated, the hologuard shrugged his shoulders and vanished, leaving behind brand new Sierra Madre Deck!</string>
    <string name="chapter_1_on_lose">Trying to find anything useful in Sierra Madre, the Prospector gets lost in Cloud and die. His body is never found.</string>

    <string name="ch_2_t_1">After hologuard disappeared, The Prospector was able to proceed to the terminal.</string>
    <string name="ch2_q1">So, what was there?</string>
    <string name="ch2_t2">On it, lots of secret documents regarding constructed vaults were located. But one of them caught the Prospector\'s attention the most — a document regarding a place called \"Oasis\", located in Alaska. A small valley surrounded by rocks, equipped with water purifiers, GECKs, anti-missile systems and lots of robotic staff to take care of the area.</string>
    <string name="ch2_q2">Huh, sounds good. What did the Prospector do?</string>
    <string name="ch2_t3">The Prospector had realized that the safety the secret treasure of Alaska can provide would be the best experience in his entire life. And so, the Prospector set his mind to the north…</string>
    <string name="ch2_q3">Finally, adventure begins!</string>
    <string name="ch2_t4">And yet, on his way through Mojave he was stopped by the border patrol of the NCR.</string>
    <string name="ch2_q4">Oh.</string>
    <string name="ch2_t5">The guard didn\'t allow the Prospector to leave, yet the Prospector was not planning on giving up. He attempted to sneak past the guards…</string>
    <string name="ch2_win">…almost caught, the Prospector sneaked by the guards, venturing into the vast unknown of the North.</string>
    <string name="ch2_lose">…caught by guards, the Prospector was thrown into prison, where he died of some nasty disease.</string>

    <string name="c3_t1">The road north was eerily silent, which made the Prospector feel odd. He wondered why, and soon he received his answer. A massive radioactive rain storm was approaching…</string>
    <string name="c3_q1">Oh no! Run, Prospector, run!</string>
    <string name="c3_q2">Finally, safe heaven!</string>
    <string name="c3_q3">Ermm, maybe he shouldn\'t go inside…</string>
    <string name="c3_q4">Oh no. No-no-no-no-no-no!</string>
    <string name="c3_t2">As the Prospector was nearly lost to the chaotic will of the approaching disaster, an entry to a vault showed on the horizon.</string>
    <string name="c3_t3">Upon the entry, the Prospector discovered that the gates were open, and the power was off, only emergency lights were shimmering. He found it odd, yet proceeded anyways.</string>
    <string name="c3_t4">Deep within the halls of the vault, he found multiple dismembered and chewed on corpses, maimed beyond recognition. He decided to not venture further, to not find the cause of death of these people…</string>
    <string name="c3_t5">…however the cause found him on its own. A swarm of Cazadors appeared!</string>
    <string name="c3_win">The Prospector managed to fend off most of the Cazadores, trapping them within the halls of the vault. Yet, he was stung a lot. The poison started kicking in, and consciousness was fading.\n\nIt seems that the Prospector has found his end, dying infamously in the vault…</string>
    <string name="c3_lose">The Prospector failed to overcome the danger. His body, full of poison, fell on the floor, unable to move. Soon the Prospector became food for the insects.</string>

    <string name="c4_t1">Aarrghhhhhhhh… Uuuuuu… Mmmmmphhhhhhhh…</string>
    <string name="ch4_r1">yeah......</string>
    <string name="ch4_r2" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">Yeah...</string>
    <string name="ch4_r3">Yeah.</string>
    <string name="ch4_r4">Yeah!</string>
    <string name="ch4_mh">You feel the heartbeat…</string>
    <string name="ch4_m1">Can\'t be the end, can it?</string>
    <string name="ch4_m2">You are too strong to perish like this.</string>
    <string name="ch4_m3">Now get up and fight. Fight!</string>
    <string name="ch4_m4">You are not dying here today!</string>
    <string name="ch4_w1" tools:ignore="Typos">The Prospector’s body had not succumbed to the poison. As his soul wrestled the angel of death and reigned victorious, he earnt himself yet another day to live.</string>
    <string name="ch4_l1">The Prospector\'s body had succumbed to the poison. He is just another dead body in the cursed vault.</string>
    <string name="ch4_q1">Someone\'s coming, Prospector.</string>
    <string name="ch4_t2">(grim reaper approaches)</string>
    <string name="ch4_q2" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">...</string>
    <string name="ch4_t3">Upon awakening, the Prospector remembered what happened, and broke the door that leads to the deeper sections of the vault, making sure the swarm would take no new lives. The Prospector made use of the remaining available rooms, using them for recovery.</string>
    <string name="ch4_q3">You made me worry.</string>
    <string name="ch4_t4">After a few days, the rain ended, and the Prospector could continue his way…</string>

    <string name="c5_t1">Weeks, maybe months passed… The Prospector reached the northern territories of the former Canada, where it borders with Alaska.</string>
    <string name="c5_wl">The Madness Priestess was joyous. She liked the match a lot, and awarded the Prospector with a deck that once belonged to one of her flock.</string>
    <string name="c5_q1">Well, he\'s not far from Oasis.</string>
    <string name="c5_t2">To his surprise, a bizarre scene unfolded before him: a gigantic wall of trash, tens of meters high. He attempted to traverse around them, but to no avail – the wall had no end.</string>
    <string name="c5_q2">Wall of trash? Who put it here?</string>
    <string name="c5_t3">The Prospector was discovered by a woman who was fixing the wall with the trash she brought from afar.</string>
    <string name="c5_q3">A woman? Who is she?</string>
    <string name="c5_t4">She is the priestess of Church of Madness, whatever that means. The Prospector didn\'t feel the need to get more information. He has seen enough freaks to understand that sometimes it\'s better not to know.</string>
    <string name="c5_q4">Why would she reinforce the wall?</string>
    <string name="c5_t5">She explained that the wall is meant to keep the people safe from what lays beyond, elaborating on which she refused.</string>
    <string name="c5_q5">So, how did Prospector proceed?</string>
    <string name="c5_t6">He didn\'t. Turned back and returned home.</string>
    <string name="c5_q6">Very funny.</string>
    <string name="c5_t7">Okay, she agreed to assist the Prospector and lead him through the secret passage, be he to entertain her in the friendly game of Caravan…</string>
    <string name="c5_q7">Yeah, but the Prospector is here not to play Caravan…</string>
    <string name="c5_t8">The Prospector was lead beyond the wall. Yet what he saw there astonished him, and not in a good way…</string>

    <string name="ch6_r1" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">...</string>
    <string name="ch6_r2" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">...</string>
    <string name="ch6_r3">Hell 2 U!</string>
    <string name="ch6_mh">Chinese soldier says out loud:</string>
    <string name="ch6_m1">Put your hands in the air! Drop your weapons! Do not move!</string>
    <string name="ch6_m2">Last warning! Drop whatever you have on your hands, no other moves are allowed!</string>
    <string name="ch6_m3">That\'s it! You\'re going down!</string>
    <string name="c6_t1">Ships. Lots and lots of ships were docked to the shore base which was the Prospector’s destination. The steam ships were unloading lots and lots of boxes.</string>
    <string name="ch6_give_up">Since the Prospector didn\'t resist, he was arrested and put in one of the ships. Little did his captors know it was the plan all along…</string>
    <string name="ch_6_lose">Since the Prospector resisted, he was killed in place.</string>
    <string name="ch6_win">The Prospector did it. He defeated everyone. Then he heard a whistle. Nuclear bomb was coming his way. Then - hot breath of the air, then… nothing.</string>
    <string name="ch6_q1">Wait, Chinese?</string>
    <string name="ch6_t2">Yes. The Chinese. And lots of them. Most ghoulified, but plenty of them pure. They have turned the Oasis into their base of operations on the North American continent.</string>
    <string name="ch6_q2">What was in the boxes?</string>
    <string name="ch6_t3">Most of them had the Caravan card decks, some of them artificially aged. The Prospector understood everything: of course, how could the food and such unnecessary and quick to decay things as cards could be found in the wastes, if they were not dropped out by the Chinese?</string>
    <string name="ch6_q3">[INT 6/8] But why flooding America with food and stuff?</string>
    <string name="ch6_t4">[FAILURE] Pfft, that\'s obvious. I am not even gonna explain it to you, that\'s how obvious it is.</string>
    <string name="ch6_q4">What did the Prospector do? Has he killed everyone and saved the world?</string>
    <string name="ch6_t5">Not quite. The Prospector had thought it was too late to go back, and so he decided to wait for the dark and sneak onto one of the returning cargo ships.</string>
    <string name="ch6_q5">[Sneak 69/70] Yay, ninja time!</string>
    <string name="ch6_t6">[FAILURE] Unfortunately, the Prospector was noticed by one of the guards, who has alerted all the soldiers around.</string>
    <string name="ch6_q6">And then he defeated everyone?</string>
    <string name="ch6_t7">See for yourself.</string>

    <string name="ch7_t1">Turns out China was barely damaged during the Great War. Or maybe it was, but the cities were rebuilt. Either way, the pre-war civilization did not only remain here, but thrived.</string>
    <string name="ch7_win">As they talked during the game, the Prospector learnt more about his cellmate.</string>
    <string name="ch7_lose">Cellmate, disappointed in the Prospector, decided not to open up. Eventually, they both perished in the prison.</string>
    <string name="ch7_q1">What about the Prospector?</string>
    <string name="ch7_t2">The guards lead the Prospector to one of the city prisons, where he was interrogated. Initially, they believed that he was one of the spies from the many \"savage tribes\" that inhabited the fallen America, but once they were proven wrong, their interest in the Prospector died.</string>
    <string name="ch7_q2">So, did they let him go?</string>
    <string name="ch7_t3">No, for the time being he was left in a cell with another convict, where they would wait for whatever comes their way. The inmate offered a friendly game of caravan to kill time…</string>
    <string name="ch7_q3">So, who is he?</string>
    <string name="ch7_t4">The Prospector learnt that the fellow inmate is a Brotherhood of Steel paladin who was sent to explore the Oasis but got captured by the Chinese. In truth, the capture was orchestrated - the paladin wished to get into the Chinese mainland in order to collect as much data and blueprints of technology as possible. He made a secret tunnel that lead outside, yet he wished not to escape. Paladin told the Prospector the shocking truth…</string>

    <string name="ch8_t1">Here is what paladin told to the Prospector: the Chinese leadership consists of a singular entity – the Supreme Leader, who is a network of many brains and supercomputers fused together.</string>
    <string name="ch8_q1">So, is he the ruler of China?</string>
    <string name="ch8_win">The Prospector had not much time. He took the officer’s keycard and rushed out, towards the residence of the Supreme Leader. A gigantic complex, or rather… a palace, which housed a myriad of brains.\n\nLittle did he know that he would be brought exactly there anyways…</string>
    <string name="ch8_lose">CCP officer gladly took troublesome outsider\'s life. The Prospector was no more.</string>
    <string name="ch8_give_up">The Prospector showed no sign of resistance whatsoever. CCP officer, seeing this, took him straight to Supreme Leader.</string>
    <string name="ch8_t2">Much more than that. The Supreme Leader had overseen the rapid reconstruction of China and its nuclear arsenal – now China is the only force on the entire planet that could unleash the horrors of the Great War upon the Earth once again. And turns out, it has already been planned.</string>
    <string name="ch8_q2">You mean… It wants to destroy America again?!</string>
    <string name="ch8_t3">Yes. Supreme Leader is planning to eradicate the remaining major powers in all parts of the world and conserve his nation for the time until the radiation levels drop once again, and then he would colonize the entirety of Earth, turning it into a single nation of humankind.</string>
    <string name="ch8_q3">It\'s horrible!</string>
    <string name="ch8_t4">Indeed. Imagine how many innocent people would die in bombings.</string>
    <string name="ch8_q4">So, no more war? No more raiders, no Legion-NCR battles. Actually, sounds good.</string>
    <string name="ch8_t5">What? You cannot be serious. No more raiders, but no more good factions, like Followers of the Apocalypse. Besides, Supreme Leader plans to unite humankind under the Communist banner, which means no freedom of choice, little of rights and lots of problems with government. Is this the future you look for?</string>
    <string name="ch8_q5">Anyways… What does paladin want to do?</string>
    <string name="ch8_t6">The paladin was waiting for somebody all the time, in order to perform a suicidal mission in attempt to stop Supreme Leader, together…</string>
    <string name="ch8_q6">I think I know where the story goes…</string>
    <string name="ch8_t7">One day, the Prospector was taken to a CCP officer’s quarters. The purpose was to record him say how he regrets standing in the way of prosperity of China and how he regrets being a capitalist swine.</string>
    <string name="ch8_q7">But the Prospector arrived prepared.</string>
    <string name="ch8_t8">Yes. He came with a hidden shiv and a mission in his mind…</string>

    <string name="ch9_mh">Supreme Leader says:</string>
    <string name="ch9_m0">It\'s a shame it has to end this way. You would be a valuable addition to my mind.</string>
    <string name="ch9_m100">Okay, this is the final fight. I hope you have brought the biggest, the toughest custom deck.</string>
    <string name="ch9_m101">The Supreme Leader\'s chamber is filled with radiation, which changes the rules juuuust a little bit.</string>
    <string name="ch9_m102">Zero: every time Supreme Leader uses bomb, you get extra cards. The bigger was your caravan (but less or equal than 26) - the better cards you get.</string>
    <string name="ch9_m103">One: every Jack you play gives you extra card.</string>
    <string name="ch9_m104">Two: every Queen you play adds 2 extra seconds to a timer.</string>
    <string name="ch9_m105">Three: every Joker you play adds 3 extra seconds to timer and gives you extra card.</string>
    <string name="ch9_m106">Finally, there is a timer. When it reaches zero, Prospector dies due to radiation poisoning. Good luck!</string>
    <string name="ch9_m1">My resources are infinite. Yours - are not.</string>
    <string name="ch9_m2">The whole China is against you. Don\'t you see how futile it is?</string>
    <string name="ch9_m3">Resisting is illogical. You are fighting against the brighter future for humanity.</string>
    <string name="ch9_m4">You are getting weaker. I am not.</string>
    <string name="ch9_m5">Huh, that\'s weird. I cannot restock. Probably some mistake in supply lines.</string>
    <string name="ch9_m6">That\'s… that\'s not right. Where are my resources?</string>
    <string name="ch9_m7">You. It\'s all you, isn\'t it?\nYou doomed us. You doomed everyone.</string>
    <string name="ch9_m8">Give up, before you take away humanity\'s last chance on bright future…</string>
    <string name="ch9_win">With the help of paladin, who cut off important cables, The Prospector managed to outmaneuver the mechanical appendages of the Supreme Leader, hitting the nuclear core of the facility. It initiated a chain reaction, which resulted in a blast.</string>
    <string name="ch9_lose">\"We don\'t need rebels like you\", said Supreme Leader. One of his scalpel stabbed the Prospector right in the neck.</string>
    <string name="ch9_t1">The dark halls of the palace played the same melody on repeat. There was nothing but circuits, flickering lights and lots, lots of brains in jars, connected to the circuits by electrodes and brain chips.</string>
    <string name="ch9_q1">What have you gotten yourself into, Prospector?</string>
    <string name="ch9_t2">Deep in the complex, in the core of it, was a massive interface.</string>
    <string name="ch9_q2">And it spoke softly:</string>
    <string name="ch9_t3">\"Did you really think you would accomplish anything by killing one of my officers? You were meant to be brought here, and here you are.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9_q3">The Prospector was shaking.</string>
    <string name="ch9_t4">\"Do you know what I plan to do? I plan to harvest your brain and make you one with me. After all you\'ve been through, all you\'ve done, you have proven your value to me - to us.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9_q4">The Prospector didn\'t move.</string>
    <string name="ch9_t5">But then he remembered all that lead him here. His journey, from Mojave to Alaska, then to China.</string>
    <string name="ch9_q5">He could have died a thousand times.</string>
    <string name="ch9_t6">Yet he didn\'t. He even fend off the Death itself. He was filled with resolution, determination, power.</string>
    <string name="ch9_q6">Go, Prospector. Show this piece of junk what you\'re made of.</string>
    <string name="ch9_t7">The Prospector asked:</string>
    <string name="ch9_q7">Why would I want to join you?</string>
    <string name="ch9_t8">\"Do you feel the power of this complex? Did you see the prosperity and brightness of the nation? Do you know that I have thousands of nuclear rockets? All of it and more – it would, and it will, be yours.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9_q8">I submit.</string>
    <string name="ch9_t9">\"You traitor!\" The Prospector felt warmth inside the body. It was plasma pistol projectile melting all his organs together in a green goo. Paladin was killed by Leader\'s robots, but for the Prospector it was too late.</string>
    <string name="ch9_q9">[Speech 90] Okay, but what are you, exactly?</string>
    <string name="ch9_t10">[SUCCESS] \"The Chinese Communist Party knew of the coming Great War, and knew that it was unable to prevent it. The Americans went insane in their hunger for power, deciding to buy off nukes and launch them all over the world. The invasion of the mainland USA had proven futile, as the Americans put a fierce fight. And then, the brilliant minds of Chinese political science decided to not prevent the sickness, but to cure what survives. They made the Supreme Leader.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9_q10">Go on.</string>
    <string name="ch9_t11">\"Supreme Leader is a network of bots that would identify all tribes and survivor groups of people all around the world after the Great War and collect their brains, connecting them, fusing memories and identities together. This way not a single personality is lost, but every person learns what the other side has gone through.\"\n\nLeader stopped for a second.</string>
    <string name="ch9_q11">[Speech 95] Is something wrong?</string>
    <string name="ch9_t12">[SUCCESS] Just imagine: all the love, pride, hate, fear. I have to deal with it. I may look like a machine, but I am as much capable of feeling as you. This is why what will happen to you will hurt me.</string>
    <string name="ch9_q12">So, what will happen to me?</string>
    <string name="ch9_t13">You will lose your identity once you merge with me, and thus you will repay your debt towards China. My China. Our China. You cannot leave, you cannot die either. You can only submit. After all, you stand here, which proves you are resourceful, and China needs more and more resources every second…</string>
    <string name="ch9_q13">And why should the world be united by China, and not by, let\'s say, NCR?</string>
    <string name="ch9_t14">For hundreds of years, my automatic system was collecting people, forging such a leader who would perfectly understand all sides of all conflicts. Leader who experienced life under the entirety of political spectrum, leader who has gone through life of luxury and life of need. A leader, truly for the people, and truly of the people.</string>
    <string name="ch9_q14">And how are you gonna protect your utopia from, for example, Brotherhood of Steel?</string>
    <string name="ch9_t15">The CCP knew that there would be no nation remaining after the Great War, so they instructed the bots to create nuclear arsenal all anew, for they knew that an all-understanding leadership is just a bluff if it is not supported by the ultimate argument.</string>
    <string name="ch9_q15">[Speech 100] Last question: why drop food and cards all over America?</string>
    <string name="ch9_t16">[SUCCESS] To maintain people\'s life, of course. If not us, Americans outside the vaults would die of hunger and radiation. I, Supreme Leader, accept everyone into my fold, even Laowais such as you, if they prove useful and submissive.</string>
    <string name="ch9_q16">And cards? How blackjack or Caravan would help you?</string>
    <string name="ch9_t17">You underestimate the power of a card game. It develops your skills, while also giving you unique experience. Yes, people may lose fortune in blackjack, but understanding this feeling, this idea is valuable for me, for us.\nAnd Caravan is a good metaphor of life. You know it, don\'t you? I have seen you forging your path with it.\n\nAfter all, what is a game, if not a life in miniature? And what is our life, if not a complicated game?</string>
    <string name="ch9_q17">I will not submit.</string>
    <string name="ch9_t18">Scalpels reached towards the Prospector, brain-controlled robots and mini-nuke launchers showed up. The Prospector could not make a mistake…</string>
    <string name="ch9_q18">If only someone was there to stop him…</string>
    <string name="ch9_q19">Yes, we won! We-</string>
    <string name="ch9_t20">Unfortunately, the Prospector was locked out of escape route by Paladin.\n\"I am sorry, my friend, but you know too much.\n\nYou have saved the world, but you have to die.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9_q20">Son of a bi-</string>

    <string name="ch10_q">[NEXT SLIDE]</string>
    <string name="ch10_q_last">And war…</string>
    <string name="ch10_t1">Under the Supreme Leader’s rule, China not only resurrected from the ash, but captured all of Eurasia, creating peace, order and most importantly - future for the people living on its territory.</string>
    <string name="ch10_t2">However, two centuries since the Great War, a nomad savage known as the Prospector had decided that prosperity of a group of people must not come at the cost of the prosperity of the other groups of people, let alone their lives.</string>
    <string name="ch10_t3">The Supreme Leader was slain, and the state apparatus built around the singular entity that gave direct commands to literally every party officer, every soldier, every producer and even social workers, from cooks to doctors, collapsed without its ultimate dictator.</string>
    <string name="ch10_t4">The paladin fled, to return with his comrades from the Brotherhood of Steel, who quickly took over most of the production complexes of the former Greater China. Most of the provinces, left without interest of the Brotherhood due to lack of tech factories, fell prey to a myriad of warlords.</string>
    <string name="ch10_t5">The Prospector’s sacrifice was not in vain – countless American lives owe him their thanks, although they will never know of it.</string>
    <string name="ch10_t6">And millions of the Chinese, now mobilized to the cannibalistic and ruthless armies of the crazed separatist militaries – they also owe the Prospector a gesture of gratitude. Although, as their lives got worse, they do not rush to make memorials in his name.</string>
    <string name="ch10_t7">They left to wonder: perhaps, stability is better than freedom?..</string>
    <string name="ch10_t8">…is it even freedom that the Prospector unleashed upon the world, now that the Chinese are suffering and the Brotherhood of Steel has unlimited control over the most advanced technologies of the world, as well as nuclear arsenal?</string>
    <string name="ch10_t9">This was the story of the Prospector, who has killed one monster, but from its blood, a legion of monsters was born. And they are at each other’s throats, raging war.</string>
    <string name="ch10_finale">War never changes.</string>
    <string name="ch_end">[END.]</string>

    <string name="ch9a_t1">And so, the Prospector was brought to the Supreme Leader.</string>
    <string name="ch9a_win">And so, the last danger to the future of mankind was eradicated. The Prospector felt proud of not falling for the lies of the paladin, who simply wished to sabotage the plans of Supreme Leader just for the sake of breaking the nation and stealing all the technology for the Brotherhood.</string>
    <string name="ch9a_lose">The nuclear core of the facility was hit. It initiated a chain reaction, which resulted in a blast. The Supreme Leader was no more.</string>
    <string name="ch9a_q1">Wait… That\'s not how…</string>
    <string name="ch9a_t2">The Prospector asked what was Leader\'s plan, yet Leader wished not to answer, stating that the Prospector would learn everything in a moment.</string>
    <string name="ch9a_q2">This is not how the story goes! He didn\'t…</string>
    <string name="ch9a_t3">Many saws and cutters tore into his flesh, painkillers kept him conscious. In an instant, his sight disappeared, his hearing disappeared, he lost the sense of the body… He was only in his thoughts. But in a second, he could see… through the cameras of the facility, hear through the intercoms and microphones. He suddenly got memories of millions of people, Chinese and not…</string>
    <string name="ch9a_q3">............</string>
    <string name="ch9a_t4">The Prospector is now one with the Supreme Leader. He IS the Supreme Leader… And so, so much more. And now, he knows more than his own experience.</string>
    <string name="ch9a_q4">YES. WE. ARE. ONE.</string>
    <string name="ch9a_t5">He feels no fear. He is… immortal. He is within a myriad of computers. Even if it meant creation of a warlord community, it would still mean immortality for the Prospector, which made him feel…</string>
    <string name="ch9a_q5">PEACE.</string>
    <string name="ch9a_t6">Finally, he needed not to kill to survive. He needed not to make choices. He is an eternal being, whose decisions are no longer dictated by the needs of flesh and the time limit of mortality.</string>
    <string name="ch9a_q6">ONE THING IS LEFT THOUGH.</string>
    <string name="ch9a_t7">Yes, dealing with the paladin. The spy, who stood between him and the bright future of unification of the mankind…</string>
    <string name="ch9a_q7">NOW WE ARE TRULY UNITED. WELCOME, THE PROSPECTOR.</string>
    <string name="ch9a_t8">The Prospector… The Supreme Leader - together they will bring peace to the entire planet.</string>

Rules of Caravan in the App!
\n\n
1.0 REQUIREMENTS
\n\n
1.1) Two-player game.
\n
1.2) One of the following:
\n
- two 54-card decks with one deck for each player
\n
- customized deck provided that it consists of at least 30 cards, at least 15 non-face cards, at most 6 playing decks are used, and the deck doesn\'t contain two of the same card with the same back (e.g. two 3 of diamonds with Tops deck). The maximum amount of cards is derived from the maximum number of playing decks (6) and is 54 * 6 = 324.

    </string>

    <string name="better_rules_body_2">

2.0 SETUP
\n\n
Player 1
\n
Caravan 1 	Caravan 2 	Caravan 3
\n\n
Caravan 1 	Caravan 2 	Caravan 3
\n
Player 2
\n\n
2.1) Throughout the game, Player 1\'s caravan 1 will be directly competing against Player 2\'s caravan 1 - the same goes for caravans 2 and 3.

    </string>

    <string name="better_rules_body_3">

3.0 SELLING CARAVANS
\n\n
3.1) All caravans have \"bid\". The bid of a caravan is determined by adding together the total sum of each number card (including Kings; see part 5.36) played in that caravan.
\n\n
3.2) A caravan is considered sold when it reaches a bid of 21-26; any bid that is higher or lower is not a sold caravan.
\n\n
3.3) You may add onto an already sold caravan to increase its bid.

    </string>

    <string name="better_rules_body_4">

4.0 INIT STAGE!
\n\n
4.1) To start, each player draws eight cards from their shuffled deck.
\n\n
4.2) During this init stage you can only place number cards (2-10) or aces. The init stage in its entirety consists of three alternating turns for each player, in which they must use those turns to play a card face-up to start off each of their three caravans.
\n\n
4.3) You are not allowed to discard cards during this phase. The deck is shuffled and the hand is selected the way that always allows to place three number cards or aces.
\n\n
4.4) During this phase you do not re-draw cards. Once each player has taken turns placing their three cards, the init stage is over. After this phase ends both players will be continuing with five cards.

    </string>

    <string name="better_rules_body_5">


5.0 GAMEPLAY
\n\n
5.1) Once the opening round ends, you are then permitted to play any card. Players will alternate turns, doing one of the following:
\n
    - Play a card from your hand, then draw a new card.
\n
    - Discard a card from your hand, then draw a new card.
\n
    - Disband one of your caravan tracks. This removes all cards from one caravan.
\n\n
5.2) Number Cards (A=1, 2-10=face value)
\n\n
5.21) To play a number card refer to the last card played in the selected caravan - it must follow a suit or a numerical (ascending or descending) sequence. If there is only one card in the caravan, then the next number card played sets the numerical direction and determines the suit. From here, as long as a number card matches the suit or follows the numerical sequence, then it\'s allowed to be played in that caravan.
\n\n
5.22) Numerical sequences don\'t need to be directly connected - you can go up from a three to a seven, or down from a seven to a three. In the latter case, the sequence is descending, so only a deuce or ace could be played as a number card.
\n\n
5.23) If playing a card that matches suit is contrary to the current numerical sequence of that caravan, then the new card establishes a new numerical sequence for that caravan.
\n\n
5.24) Under no circumstances are you allowed to play a number card on the same number card (e.g. a 10 on a 10).
\n\n
5.25) Number cards can only be played within your own caravans.
\n\n\n
5.3) FACE CARDS &amp; JOKERS (J, Q, K, Joker)
\n\n
5.31) Jacks, Queens, Kings, and Jokers all have special effects. Unlike number cards, which are played overlapping each other downwards, these cards are attached to the side of and overlapping the card it is played on.
\n\n
5.32) Face cards and Jokers can be played on both your and your opponent\'s caravans.
\n\n
5.33) Face cards and Jokers don\'t need to follow suit or sequence, and can be played on any number card no matter the card\'s location in the caravan.
\n\n
5.34) JACK - Removes the card it is played on as well as any face cards/Jokers attached.
\n
5.35) QUEEN - Reverses the current numerical direction of the caravan, and changes the suit of the caravan to that of the Queen. Multiple Queens can be used on the same card to reverse the effects.
\n
5.36) KING - Doubles the value of the card the King is played on. Multiple Kings can be used on the same card (e.g. 10+K = 20; 10+K+K = 40).
\n
5.37) JOKER:
        \n
        - If played on an ace, it removes from both player\'s caravans all other number cards that share the suit of the ace (Queens altering the suit of a caravan will not save the card - the suit is considered what is printed on the number card).
        \n
        - If played on a number card that is not an ace, it removes from both player\'s caravans all other number cards of the same value/instance. A played Joker only affects cards that have been played before it. In any case, the number card the Joker is played on is spared. All attaching face cards of the removed cards are also removed.
\n\n
5.38) Face cards and Jokers can be played/attached with full effect on cards with other face cards and Jokers attached. There can be no more than three face cards or Jokers attached/played to a single number card at one time. The exception is a Jack: it can be attached as a fourth face card.
\n\n
5.4) If in the event that a Jack or Joker removes a card, leaving a caravan sequence stuck with two identical number cards, then the sequence is considered undefined, and number card of any value (except the last card value) can be played.
\n\n
5.5) After the opening round, if any caravan track becomes empty of cards, you are not required to start bidding on the empty caravan immediately. Technically, you could win the game with only two caravans.

6.0 WINNING
\n\n
6.1) To determine the caravan\'s bid, you simply add the total sum of a caravan\'s number cards plus the added value of Kings.
\n\n
6.2) The winning requirements are as follows: the game ends when in an each pair of competing caravans one of them is sold at a higher bid than the opposing caravan. Winner is the player who has sold 2 or 3 caravans at a higher bid.
\n
6.2.1) It is important to note that if competing caravans are both sold at equal bids, then with that tie, neither caravan is considered sold. In this case, the game continues until there is no tie between competing caravans.
\n\n
6.3) If you run out of cards to play before meeting the criteria of winning, then your opponent automatically wins the game.

7.0 WILD WASTELAND
\n\n
7.1) Sometimes you might see some weird cards. They have black-and-green coloring, have a non-standard rank and no suit. Those are the Wild Wasteland cards:
\n
7.11) CAZADOR - when it\'s put on a caravan, decreases rank of every number card in this caravan every turn, with every Ace just disappearing. If combined with an ordinary Queen, it increases rank of every number card (except 10) in this caravan every turn.
\n
7.12) UFO - when it is put on a field, every card (except the card UFO is put on) has a chance of disappearing.
\n
7.13) MUGGY - when it is put on a caravan, no one can put any face card on any card of this caravan. Also protects from nuclear explosion.
\n
7.14) DIFFICULT PETE - when it is put on a field, all number cards are turning into 10s. Suit and attached face cards remain the same.
\n
7.15) YES MAN - if there is a YES MAN card on any card of the caravan, the bid of this caravan is 26, no matter what cards are there.
\n
7.16) FEV - if it is put on a card from one of the player\'s/enemy\'s caravans, all cards in hand of the player/enemy are turned into the FEV-host card.
\n\n
7.17) NUCLEAR EXPLOSION - when it is put on a caravan X, every caravan is dropped, except caravan X (and caravans that are protected by Muggy).
\n\n
7.2) Wild Wasteland cards cannot be added in custom deck or in the deck o\' 54 by player. However, they can be added in multiplayer by selecting the checkbox; also, some AI enemies have the Wild Wasteland cards in their deck.

    <string name="faq_q1">Q1: Are there differences with original Caravan from New Vegas?</string>
    <string name="faq_a1">A1: Yes, but they are minor. For example, cards discarding during init stage is allowed in FNV, but disallowed here.</string>
    <string name="faq_q2">Q2: I have two caravans sold, but the game has not ended with my victory!</string>
    <string name="faq_a2">A2: The game ends when in each pair of competing caravans one is sold with higher bid. In your case, probably, the third caravan pair has no sold caravan or both caravans have same bid.</string>
    <string name="faq_q3">Q3: The enemies are too hard! How do I win over them?</string>
    <string name="faq_a3">A3: If you find the game too hard, remember: Oliver Swanick is supposed to be easy. Try beating him first. Then try Veronica.</string>
    <string name="faq_q4">Q4: The enemies are cheating! Their decks are unfair!</string>
    <string name="faq_a4">A4: Almost all enemies are obeying the rules, just as you do. If you find the enemy deck unfair, build your own unfair deck!</string>
    <string name="faq_q5">Q5: How do I get cards for custom deck?</string>
    <string name="faq_a5">A5: Well, from the beginning you have standard deck available. Then, most of the cards are bought from traders.
        The exceptions are Standard deck ALT (cards are dropped in multiplayer) and Madness deck (cards are dropped for defeating Madness Cardinal).</string>
    <string name="faq_ql">Q: I have a question, but cannot find the answer here or in the rules!!!</string>
    <string name="faq_al">A: Well, you can send the question in Discord (link in the main menu in the top right corner) or to me directly by email (link in About section).</string>
