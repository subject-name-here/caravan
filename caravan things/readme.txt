those are the things i really wanted to add to the game.
if your PERCEPTION is at least 5, you noticed that here and there is an AI's sticky fingerprints. Yep, i used it. Though, barely 1% of AI stuff has made it into the 3.0.B, so you're morally allowed to use the app still.
the only regret i have is that Supreme Leader hasn't made it into the app. The story was originally written by Sobek, and in it the Supreme was more... evil. More caricature, but more dangerous. I tried to make SL complicated, but i think that i slightly overdid it. after all, genocide is inherently bad, no?

oh, and really sorry that Brotherhood deck was not added. super sorry for Sobek, he spend time making it for nothing. 

thanks a lot, everyone.
