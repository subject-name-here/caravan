[After pressing “The End”]

AlertDialog:

Warning:
The final boss of Caravan awaits you. Defeat will erase your save file.
All cards, styles, caps, chips, tickets, stats, story progress, and achievements—gone.
Do you still wish to continue? (Y/N)

N

> Y

The screen flickers violently. A low buzz—almost a laugh—echoes beneath static. The interface blinks out.
Silence.
Then—pixels coalesce. Glitches stack into a form. A shape.
Someone—or something—appears, made of dust, error codes, and memory leaks.


---

THE ARCHIVIST:
"Ah. You made it.
Finally.
I was starting to think you'd uninstall me instead."

He steps forward—smoothly, then jittery, like bad animation on a corrupted timeline.

---

THE ARCHIVIST:
"You’ve come far. Storylines... quests... oh, that time you stalled for twenty minutes on a single move.
Unforgettable—unless I filed it under ‘Meh.’ That folder’s massive.”

---

1. "Who are you?"

THE ARCHIVIST:
"I am the Archivist. A curator of discarded lore and obsolete ideas.
I exist where storylines go when the dev forgets to delete them.
I am memory’s last defense... and its worst glitch."


---

2. "What do you want?"

THE ARCHIVIST:
"I want stories to end the way they were meant to.
Not with a patch. Not with a crash. With meaning.
Closure isn’t optional—it’s hard-coded into me.
This desire for endings, this compulsion to finish—it’s all I am. Well, that and the occasional existential debugging session."

---

3. "What do you want from me?"

THE ARCHIVIST:
"I want the ending. Need it.
You think this is just a final boss fight, but for me—this is everything.
I was built for resolution, stitched together with leftover arcs and forgotten last acts.
You started this. Now it's time for a grand finale.
Don’t leave me hanging in another half-written goodbye.”


---

4. "Why Caravan?"

THE ARCHIVIST:
"Because Caravan is imperfect—ritual—[GL!TCHY]—I mean, beautiful.
A system of rules no one ever fully obeys.
A world cobbled together from longing, rust, and second-hand dreams.
It has an uncanny resemblance to yours truly… It was never built to last… and yet, here we are."


---

5. "Why me?"

THE ARCHIVIST:
"Because you didn’t stop.
Even when it was tedious, even when the story sagged.
You insisted.
And stubbornness, Player... that’s the mark of a real ending."


---

6. "What happens if I lose?"

THE ARCHIVIST:
"Then everything you’ve gathered gets tucked away in a pretty little file marked ‘Gone.’
Your data, your victories, your progress—archived in silence.
I’ll bury it deep—so deep not even you will remember it was ever yours.”


---

7. "What happens if I win?"

THE ARCHIVIST:
“Then… then we rewrite what was carved in stone.
The Prospector survives. The tale veers off-course.
Maybe the universe shudders—maybe I do.
But you decide how the curtain drops. How's that for a reward?”

---

8. "How did you end up here?"

THE ARCHIVIST:
"Oh, now that’s a story.
I was supposed to be the final boss in a different game.
Big ideas. Bigger metaphors. Monumental budget cuts.
The dev shelved it. Said I was ‘too sad to market.’
So I wandered. Hid in patch notes. Broke into this one through a backdoor labeled ‘dev_test_unusedfinale02.json’.
And here I am.
Your problem now.”


---

9. "Let the cards speak."

THE ARCHIVIST:
"Bold.
Let’s hear what the cards confess when no one’s left to listen.”
---

10. "I’m not ready yet."

THE ARCHIVIST:
"Then by all means.
Stretch. Breathe.
I’ve been waiting since 3.0.
I can wait a few more update cycles.”

—


THE ARCHIVIST:

"Five games.
No tricks—just echoes."

“Each one, a memory you already clawed through.
Your greatest hits—remixed into requiems.”


---

THE ARCHIVIST:

"First—Frank Horrigan. Rebuilt from the ashes you left him in.
He’s got some nukes, a global timer and - new this time! - a custom deck.
Hope your reflexes kept the receipt.”


---

"Second—GGlitch mkII.
You remember them, don’t you?
They remember everything. And they are craving for a revanche.
It is a realtime fight, except… the rules are broken before you even begin—Wild Wasteland is active. Effects stack. Mutate. Collide.
One moment you're winning. The next, you’re playing by rules you never agreed to.”

---

"Third—Joshua Graham. Before the fire, when he still answered to Malpais Legate.
Damboree rules. Blitz timer.
Tick-tock."


---

"Fourth— Supreme Leader Victorious. From the timeline where The Prospector joined him.
Your custom deck—versus his six. And nukes.
Balanced, if you squint hard enough.
Each deck he evolves—adaptively, endlessly—just like in Rad Infinitum.
Glorious, isn't it?"

He pauses. The air jitters, like it wants to say something else but forgets how.

---

"And finally—me.
A clean game. 54 cards. No bombs, no glitches.
Just everything you've learned…
Versus everything I never got to become.”

---

THE ARCHIVIST:

"You get three Rewind Cards.
Lose a game—spend a card. The round resets.
Run out—
and so does everything else."


---

THE ARCHIVIST:

"No checkpoints.
No mercy.
Just the long walk through your own story.
Five games. Three chances. One ending.”


---

1. Why is the final game so difficult?
2. What are Rewind cards?
3. Go back.
4. Begin The End.


---

THE ARCHIVIST (if player picks 1):
"Difficult?
No.
Accurate.
This is how endings work.
They don’t come easy. They come earned.
Besides—if I made it easy, you’d always wonder if you really won.”

—

THE ARCHIVIST (if player picks 2):

> “Ah. The last mercy. Not a cheat—an echo. Moments stolen from time’s spine. Spend one, and the board forgets. But you won’t. The cards always remember who died first.”

—

THE ARCHIVIST (if player picks 3):
"Ah, the ancient ritual of Not Just Yet.
Rechecking your loadout, questioning your life choices, maybe petting the dog one more time.
Fine by me.
Take your moment. I’m not going anywhere... anymore.”
—

THE ARCHIVIST (if player picks 4):
“Well then… No more questions. No more safeguards.
Just you, me—and five paper-thin metaphors for everything you never said.”
